The main active ingredient in coffee is\ncaffeine, considered the most consumed psychoactive drug on the planet.\nBut where does coffee come from and what is its effect when we drink it? First I tell you that it comes from the fruit of the Coffea arabica plant, native to Ethiopia.\nAccording to legend, a 9th century shepherd named Kaldi noticed that his goats had more\nenergy after eating coffee berries, so he decided to try them too.\nBut historical records suggest that it was the Sufis of Yemen who\nroasted the seed of the coffee berry.  to create the drink we know today.\nIn the 15th century, the first coffee houses began to appear throughout the Ottoman Empire.\nAnd in the following centuries they spread throughout Europe.\nThese European cafes became a space to discuss\nbusiness, politics and new ideas. And the philosopher Jurgen Habermas even said that\nwithout coffee we would not have had the Enlightenment. And it was precisely the ideas of that\nEuropean cultural and intellectual movement that radically changed the world: they led to the overthrow\nof monarchs, the growth of democracy, and great scientific discoveries.\nAnd what did coffee have to do with all that? Although coffee also had a\nrole in the slave trade. The French used slaves from Africa\non Haitian plantations and in the early 19th century, Brazil produced a third of the\nworld's coffee with slave labor. Some even say it helped\nfuel capitalism.\n But let's fast forward to the present:\n2 billion cups of coffee are currently consumed every day.\nIt is an industry that generates 90 billion dollars a year.\nAnd it is part of the daily life of billions of people.\n But how does coffee affect our body? When caffeine enters the\ndigestive system, it is absorbed through the intestine and enters the bloodstream.\nAlthough its effects only begin to be felt when it reaches the nervous system.\nCaffeine has a chemical structure very similar to a substance produced by\nour own body: adenosine. Caffeine binds to the\nbody's adenosine receptors, which can be found on the surface of nerve cells.\nIt's like a key that opens a lock. Adenosine is known to slow down the\nsympathetic nervous system and therefore reduces the heart rate and creates a\nstate of drowsiness and relaxation. By blocking these receptors,\ncaffeine generates the opposite effect. Blood pressure, for example, may\nincrease slightly, especially if you are not used to drinking coffee frequently.\nThe same goes for brain activity: Caffeine stimulates the brain, reduces\nhunger and helps keep you alert, so you can concentrate longer.\nCaffeine can have a positive impact on mood, inhibit feelings of fatigue,\nand even improve physical performance.    That is why many athletes\nuse it as a supplement. All of these effects can last\nbetween 15 minutes and 2 hours. The body eliminates caffeine between 5\nand 10 hours after consumption. Although its residual effects may last longer.  It is worth remembering that caffeine is not only found in coffee, it\nis also found in yerba mate, green tea, guarana and cocoa, among other plants.    It is\nalso added to energy drinks, soft drinks and medications.\nWhat changes is the concentration in each product.\nFor example, an espresso has about 64 milligrams of caffeine while\na green tea has 28 milligrams. Now, coffee requires some\ncare when consuming it. For healthy adults, the recommended limit is 400\nmilligrams of caffeine per day, which is equivalent to about four or five cups of coffee.\nExceeding this limit may cause some side effects such as insomnia, irritation,\nanxiety, tachycardia, upset stomach, nausea and headache.\nOf course, these limits vary, especially because some people are\ngenetically more sensitive to caffeine. But when enjoyed in moderation,\ncoffee can be good for your health. And reduce the risk of diabetes,\nsome cardiovascular diseases, and even Parkinson's.\nAnd these health benefits are not just related to caffeine.\nCoffee has other beneficial substances, such as chlorogenic acid, a powerful antioxidant that\ncan reduce the risk of many diseases.",
